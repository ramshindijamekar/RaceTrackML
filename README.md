# RacetrackML

## Introduction:
The RacetrackML project aims to analyze and predict race outcomes in Formula 1 events using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical race data, My goal is to provide valuable insights and predictions that can aid racing teams, fans, and stakeholders in making informed decisions.

## Data Collection:
For this project, I collected data from various sources, including official Formula 1 APIs and specialized websites dedicated to racing statistics. The data encompasses a wide range of attributes, such as race results, driver profiles, circuit details, and weather conditions.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Before conducting any analysis, I performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure the quality and consistency of the data. This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. Additionally, I applied preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling and encoding categorical variables to prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
My exploratory data analysis revealed interesting insights into the world of motorsport. Through various visualizations and statistical analysis, I uncovered trends and patterns in race results, driver performances, and circuit characteristics. For example, I observed a correlation between circuit weather conditions and race outcomes, with certain weather conditions favoring specific drivers or teams.

## Feature Engineering:
To enhance the predictive power of my models, I engineered new features from the existing data. This included calculating additional attributes such as driver age at podium finishes and incorporating circuit weather conditions as predictive variables. Feature selection techniques were also employed to identify the most relevant features for model training.

## Model Selection and Training:
In my machine learning pipeline, I experimented with several algorithms, including regression and classification models, to predict race outcomes. I evaluated the performance of each model using appropriate metrics and fine-tuned their parameters through cross-validation and grid search techniques. Additionally, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting were explored to improve predictive accuracy.

## Results and Performance:
My trained models demonstrated promising performance on test data, achieving accuracy and precision in predicting race results. Through comparative analysis, I identified the strengths and weaknesses of different modeling approaches and gained valuable insights into the factors influencing race outcomes.

## Deployment and Future Work:
Looking ahead, I plan to deploy my machine learning models as part of a user-friendly application or web platform, allowing users to access real-time predictions and analysis for upcoming races. Furthermore, I aim to continue refining my models and incorporating new data sources to improve their predictive power. With ongoing development and collaboration, the RacetrackML project holds tremendous potential to revolutionize data analytics in the motorsport industry.

I also plan to add the new data in the existing data to make the predictions upto date and accurate with the formula 1 world.
